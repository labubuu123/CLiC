## 🔄 Background Process & Exit Prevention

The app continuously runs in the background to ensure smooth OTP detection. Even if the app is minimized, it will still listen for incoming OTP notifications and automatically fill them in.

During the login process, the app prevents unintentional exits. If you accidentally press the back button, the app does not immediately close. Instead, it provides a confirmation prompt to ensure you do not accidentally log out.

2. If you want to sign out, click the triple dot on the top right and select **'Sign Out'**."
