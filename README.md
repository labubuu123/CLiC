This app is built for MMU students.

Hi, I am an Engineering student. Are you still struggling to open CLiC? Do you have to go to your browser, type in CLiC, log in with your student ID and password, and then retrieve the OTP code from your Outlook email? Sometimes, we mistype the OTP, which wastes time.

Here’s a solution for all MMU students!

App Features:
1. Loads the CLiC website inside the app
2. Automatically detects and fills in OTP codes
3. Reads OTP from notifications and submits it
4. Runs in the background to listen for OTPs
5. Asks for permission to read notifications
6. Prevents accidental exits during login
